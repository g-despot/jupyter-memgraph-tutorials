    "summary=\"'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger follows Holden Caulfield, a troubled teenager who narrates his experiences over a few days after being expelled from his elite boarding school, Pencey Prep. Set in post-World War II New York City, the story revolves around Holden’s encounters with various characters, reflecting his disillusionment with the adult world and his search for identity and meaning. The novel begins with Holden being expelled due to poor academic performance, which sets the stage for his wandering through New York City. His isolation becomes a central theme, symbolizing his struggle with mental health and alienation. Throughout the book, Holden interacts with multiple characters, including teachers, former classmates, strangers, and his younger sister, Phoebe. Each interaction reveals his distrust of adults and his disdain for what he calls phoniness. He idolizes Phoebe as a symbol of innocence and sincerity, which stands in contrast to his views on the rest of society. Holden’s fixation on preserving innocence is symbolized by his dream of being the catcher in the rye, a protector who saves children from losing their innocence. Key symbols also include his red hunting hat, which represents Holden's uniqueness and desire for protection, and the Museum of Natural History, a place he values for its permanence in contrast to life’s constant change and unpredictability. Holden’s narrative reveals symptoms of depression and lingering trauma from the death of his younger brother, Allie, which complicates his ability to cope with the challenges of adulthood. His internal struggles suggest unresolved grief and a fear of growing up. The climax of the story occurs when Holden, overwhelmed, plans to run away but has a meaningful encounter with Phoebe that changes his mind. Her innocence and love provide him with a sense of purpose, grounding him and encouraging him to continue facing his reality. By the novel’s end, Holden reluctantly begins to accept life’s imperfections and complexities. The main characters include Holden Caulfield, who is marked by cynicism, vulnerability, and compassion; Phoebe Caulfield, his younger sister who represents innocence and serves as an emotional anchor for Holden; Mr. Antolini, a former teacher who offers him guidance and represents an adult Holden partially trusts; and Allie Caulfield, Holden’s deceased younger brother, whose memory profoundly impacts him. The novel is set primarily in New York City, with scenes at Pencey Prep and various urban locations, emphasizing Holden's sense of disorientation and social critique. Themes of alienation, innocence, identity, and the challenges of adolescence permeate the novel, creating a poignant exploration of a young person grappling with mental health and the transition to adulthood.\""

This changes makes it even a better sneaker than the expensive original one, just for the great design of a real great sneaker, but not for the useless, for us common people not superstar, technique. And with it on the court, I found it enough coushion and it could give you more speed, excellent one for a guard or small forward.Whats more, it looks grat. Very soft color, tidy and clean. I like this style. So it could be a sneaker both for the court and the everyday life.Overall, its coushion is better than the Zoom Air, its more comfortable than any other sneakers without the soft real leather, including the original ones.

I am on my fourth pair of the Altitude series- a version I, version II, and now 2 version IVs. All have been good buys for me. The version IV have been the best but all have been good.First, I have a high arch and have always been hard on any footwear with a tendency to walk on the outside of my foot. I wear these boots to travel in and work in while traveling. Many a mile in airports, many miles on concrete, gravel, dirt, and inside simulation facilities. When I travel I tend to only take these boots - my work rarely requires dress clothes, the boots look good in an open collar work environment, they are comfortable, and taking only 1 pair of shoes does cuts down on packing requirements quite a bit for longer trips (3 weeks or longer in duration).I have taken these boots on three overseas trips - they did well in the Scottish highlands (twice), and London. They did equally well on the beaches of Hawaii, Myrtle Beach, and Cancun. They have done me well in wet and sand - hot and cold.To add to this endorsement, not only am I hard on shoes I am also quite fat these days - topping 300 pounds. For my health I maintain a walking routine of 1-3 miles a day whenever possible. When I travel, these boots are also my walking shoes.In general Hi Tec have always fit me well. I go back 40 or so years to wearing the Lite series of Hi Tecs while I was in my running the Appalachians days. Given my high arches, a tendency for very bad calluses, rebuilt right ankle, 2 knees that varied doctors have wanted to cut on since early Army days, and now my weight I am very picky on shoes. These are the best of the Hi Tec boot types that I have found.I suspect I have seen the best of my current set of boots - maybe six more months or so of regular wear till they become yard work shoes till their final demise. I have never worn out the uppers in these boots. I have worn the sole down to a smooth surface and worn out the insides (after using new insole inserts a couple of times). They are tough boots.And I have a back up pair ready to take the place of the current set.On a down side, these style of boots (in general, not just Hi Tec) are not sturdy enough for doing squats in Power Lifting circles.

I wear these boots to travel in and work in while traveling. Many a mile in airports, many miles on concrete, gravel, dirt, and inside simulation facilities. When I travel I tend to only take these boots - my work rarely requires dress clothes, the boots look good in an open collar work environment, they are comfortable, and taking only 1 pair of shoes does cuts down on packing requirements quite a bit for longer trips (3 weeks or longer in duration).I have taken these boots on three overseas trips - they did well in the Scottish highlands (twice), and London. They did equally well on the beaches of Hawaii, Myrtle Beach, and Cancun. They have done me well in wet and sand - hot and cold.To add to this endorsement, not only am I hard on shoes I am also quite fat these days - topping 300 pounds. For my health I maintain a walking routine of 1-3 miles a day whenever possible. When I travel, these boots are also my walking shoes.In general Hi Tec have always fit me well. I go back 40 or so years to wearing the Lite series of Hi Tecs while I was in my running the Appalachians days. Given my high arches, a tendency for very bad calluses, rebuilt right ankle, 2 knees that varied doctors have wanted to cut on since early Army days, and now my weight I am very picky on shoes.

I have never worn out the uppers in these boots. I have worn the sole down to a smooth surface and worn out the insides (after using new insole inserts a couple of times). They are tough boots.And I have a back up pair ready to take the place of the current set.On a down side, these style of boots (in general, not just Hi Tec) are not sturdy enough for doing squats in Power Lifting circles.

I had to stop wearing them for a week until the wounds healed. But since I loved the simple not over the top look of this shoes, so I decided to give it another try at wearing them.

I wear these boots to travel in and work in while traveling. Many a mile in airports, many miles on concrete, gravel, dirt, and inside simulation facilities. When I travel I tend to only take these boots - my work rarely requires dress clothes, the boots look good in an open collar work environment, they are comfortable, and taking only 1 pair of shoes does cuts down on packing requirements quite a bit for longer trips (3 weeks or longer in duration).I have taken these boots on three overseas trips - they did well in the Scottish highlands (twice), and London. They did equally well on the beaches of Hawaii, Myrtle Beach, and Cancun. They have done me well in wet and sand - hot and cold.To add to this endorsement, not only am I hard on shoes I am also quite fat these days - topping 300 pounds. For my health I maintain a walking routine of 1-3 miles a day whenever possible. When I travel, these boots are also my walking shoes.In general Hi Tec have always fit me well.

They are tough boots.And I have a back up pair ready to take the place of the current set.On a down side, these style of boots (in general, not just Hi Tec) are not sturdy enough for doing squats in Power Lifting circles.

I had very painful feet because of plantar fascitis, and was recomended ,by my Dr.,to get a good sturdy supportive shoe. Went to the outlet mall near me and asked for a good boot that would support my ankles and help with the foot issue and put good orthotics inside them. This is what they had me try and they are comfortable, supportive, warm enough for winter, cool enough for the summer. I now buy a pair every time I need new shoes. I am a Farrier so I wear them a lot and they support my feet well.

I bought this same pair of shoes at a local store $10 cheaper thanks to a store $10 coupon! I dont go by first impressions as most users do, but rather by making an educated judgement of anything I buy these days til I try it out first! having said that looks doesnt matter to me as much as comfort, quality of material, and how well something will last.If I were to review this shoes during the break in period, I would have given it one star! the trial break in period for this pair of hiking boots during the first six weeks was very disappointing and very painful to say the least; as the heel broke through my skin, leaving me with two bleeding blisters. I had to stop wearing them for a week until the wounds healed. But since I loved the simple not over the top look of this shoes, so I decided to give it another try at wearing them. I particularly love the hooks to tight up the shoe laces!! I also felt the shoes looked well built and seem like it would last.Well it has been three months since, and must admit that I love them! they feel very comfortable, very supportive for those of us with medium to high arch, and the quality of this pair of hiking boots seem to hold up exceptionally well for someone who does an average of 40 miles of hiking per week. The bottom outsole of these shoes has not worn out one bit; as it still looks as good as new as when I first bought them.

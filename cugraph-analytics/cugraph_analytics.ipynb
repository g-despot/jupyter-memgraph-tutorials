    "This tutorial will show you how to use  **PageRank** graph analysis and **Louvain** community detection on a **Facebook dataset** containing 1.3 million relationships. Upon completing it, you will know how to run analytics algorithms on your dataset using **Python**. Then, you can run any of the following algorithms:\n",

    "- [GQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/gqlalchemy/) - used to connect Memgraph with Python\n",

    "### Memgraph with Docker\n",
    "We need *[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)* because Memgraph is a native Linux application and can't be installed on Windows and macOS. In this tutorial, we will use `memgraph/memgraph-mage:1.3-cugraph-22.02-cuda-11.5` Docker image. Check our [guide](https://memgraph.com/docs/mage/installation/cugraph) on setting everything up. Note, all `cuGraph` Docker images are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/memgraph/memgraph-mage/tags?page=1&name=cugraph). Depending on CUDA drivers on your machine, be sure to Download correct image. Check out compatibility between drivers and CUDA on official [NVIDIA page](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the `memgraph/memgraph-mage:1.3-cugraph-22.02-cuda-11.5` image, position yourself inside the `jupyter-memgraph-tutorials/cugraph-analytics` folder with the terminal. When you get there, we’ll show you a nifty \"hack\" with the docker run command.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All the data we need is inside `.csv` files, and Memgraph needs to have access to those files. But because we will run Memgraph within a Docker container and the files are currently on our machine, we need to transfer them inside the same container where the Memgraph will be running. So let's create a Docker volume by mounting our current `data/facebook_clean_data/` folder to the `/samples` folder inside the Docker containers. `.csv` files will be located inside the `/samples` folder within the Docker, where *Memgraph* will find them when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can start the `Docker image` image:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -it -p 7687:7687 -p 7444:7444 --volume ./data/facebook_clean_data/:/samples memgraph/memgraph-mage:1.3-cugraph-22.02-cuda-11.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "If successful, you should see a message similar to the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are running Memgraph vX.X.X\n",
    "To get started with Memgraph, visit https://memgr.ph/start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter notebook\n",
    "With Memgraph running, let’s install **Jupyter**. We used **jupyter-lab**, which you can install as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, `.csv` files holding the dataset we will use in the tutorial are located  in the repository folder `cugraph-analytics/data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GQLAlchemy installation\n",
    "**[GQLAlchemy](https://memgraph.com/docs/gqlalchemy/)** is an object graph mapper (OGM) used to connect to Memgraph and execute queries using **Python**. You can think of Cypher as SQL for graph databases. It contains many of the same language constructs such as CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the GQLAlachemy [installation](https://memgraph.com/docs/gqlalchemy/installation) page for installation instructions and more information. If you have `CMake`, the easiest way to install `GQLAlchemy` is with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install gqlalchemy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memgraph Lab installation\n",
    "The last piece of tech you will need is **[Memgraph Lab](https://memgraph.com/lab)**.  You will use it to connect to **Memgraph** and create data visualizations. Check out how to install **Memgraph Lab**  as a desktop application for [Windows](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph-lab/installation/windows#step-2---installing-and-setting-up-memgraph-lab), [Mac](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph-lab/installation/macos#step-2---installing-and-setting-up-memgraph-lab)  or [Linux](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph-lab/installation/linux#step-2---installing-and-setting-up-memgraph-lab), and then [connect to Memgraph database](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph-lab/connect-to-memgraph#connecting-to-memgraph).\n",

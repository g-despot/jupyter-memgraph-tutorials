# An Introduction to Graph Databases with GQLAlchemy and Python

## 📖 Description

Through this tutorial, you will learn how to create a graph model from a dataset, run Memgraph with Docker, connect to it from a Jupyter Notebook with the help of GQLAlchemy, and perform simple queries. You will explore the movies dataset consisting of two CSV files: [`movies.csv`](data/movies.csv) containing movie title and genre and [`ratings.csv`](data/ratings.csv) that holds information about users' ratings.

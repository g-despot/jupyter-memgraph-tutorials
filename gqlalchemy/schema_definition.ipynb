    "- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)\n",
    "- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be using the **GQLAlchemy** object graph mapper (OGM) to connect to Memgraph and execute **Cypher** queries easily. GQLAlchemy also serves as a Python driver/client for Memgraph. You can install it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install gqlalchemy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hint**: You may need to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) before installing GQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you got confused when I mentioned Cypher. You can think of Cypher as SQL for graph databases. It contains many of the same language constructs like `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`... and it's used to query the database."
